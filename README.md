How to play sound when a UIButton is tapped || Swift 5

Playing sound when a button is tapped could add a nice new dimension to your iOS application. Although it probably wouldnâ€™t be necessary (or make sense) to have every button in your app make a sound when tapped.

Good use cases might be when the button is disabled until the user fills out the required information on a form, the sound could be the denied like buzzer you hear when an awful act tries their luck on a talent TV Show! Or maybe a success sound when a user creates a new piece of data/entry in your app. Without doubt, the biggest use case for sound playing functionalities though would be in gaming apps.
